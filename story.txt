One once upon a time there was a professor name Mehlhase.

On a sunny day, she was walking with her dog, Sir Barkalot, who was proudly wearing Leather Pants on the Main Street, suddenly he ran off, causing a little chaos!

Sir Barkalot dashed past the Baeckerei, around the Biergarten and into Schloss Eltz.

Professor Mehlhase hurried after Sir Barkalot, calling his name, as the townsfolk chuckled and pointed at the mischievous dog in his stylish leather pants.
